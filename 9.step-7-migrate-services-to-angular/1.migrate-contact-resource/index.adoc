= Migrate Contact Resource
:toc:
:toclevels: 5

In this section we are going to start migrating our application services to Angular. We will start our migration process with the Contact resource service. So lets get started!

== Converting the Contact Resource to Angular
Our modernized `contact.resource.ts` entity has a class-based implementation that uses AngularJS services such as the `$http` module like so:

.contact.resource.ts
[source, javascript]
----
import * as angular from 'angular';

export class Contact {
  private apiRoot: string = "http://localhost:3000/contacts";
  private $http;

  constructor($http) {
    this.$http = $http;
  }

  query(params: { string: string }) {
    return this.$http.get(this.apiRoot, { params });
  }

  get(id, params?: { string: string }) {
    return this.$http.get(this.apiRoot + '/' + id, { params });
  }

  save(data: any) {
    return this.$http.post(this.apiRoot, data);
  }

  update(data: any) {
    return this.$http.put(this.apiRoot + '/' + data.id, data);
  }

  remove(data: any) {
    return this.$http.delete(this.apiRoot + '/' + data.id);
  }
}

angular
  .module("codecraft")
  .service("Contact", Contact);
----

Lets look at how we can convert this class (and its services) to Angular.

=== Replacing $http with HttpClient
The `$http` module is a core AngularJS service that facilitates communication with an `HTTP` server. In modern Angular, the equivalent to this is the `httpClient` module. Lets see how we can replace our `$http` module with the `httpClient` module in our `contact.resource.ts` entity.

First, import the `httpClient` module into our class like so:
[source, javascript]
----
import {HttpClient} from "@angular/common/http";
----

Initialize an instance of the `HttpClient` so that it can be used within our `Contact` class. We can do this by modifying our constructor to use Angular's Dependency Injection Framework like so:

[source, javascript]
----
...
import {Injectable, Inject} from "@angular/core";

export class Contact {
  private apiRoot: string = "http://localhost:3000/contacts";

  constructor(@Inject(HttpClient) private http: HttpClient) {
  }
  ...
}
...
----

NOTE: An alternative method to inject the `HttpClient` instance is to add the `@Injectable()` decorator above the class. However, this does not seem to work well in hybrid mode so I recommend using the `@Inject` decorator as shown above.

The injected `HttpClient` service will be accessible within the class via the private `http` variable.

=== Modifying service functions
Syntactically and functionality wise, the `httpClient` service is similar to the `$http` service. (which is the main reason to switch it in with `$resource` in our modernization step!) However, a key difference between the two is that the `$http` service methods return a `Promise` while the `$HttpClient` service methods return an `Observable`.

Fortunately, there is a simple fix for this. Since our application logic is already written based on promises, we can simply convert an `Observable` to a `Promise` using the `.toPromise()` method like so:

With that in mind, lets look at the `query` function:

[source, javascript]
----
query(params: { string: string }) {
  return this.$http.get(this.apiRoot, { params });
}
----

The `HttpClient` service instance is now referenced via the `http` variable. Replace the `$http` usages with `http`. Next, convert the returned `Observable` to a `Promise` using the `toPromise()` method like so:

[source, javascript]
----
query(params: { string: string }) {
  return this.http.get(this.apiRoot, { params }).toPromise();
}
----

NOTE: You will need to import the `toPromise` using `import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';`

Similarly, we can modify the `get`, `save`, `update`, and `delete` functions so that our final `contact.resource.ts` class will look like so:

.contact.resource.ts
[source, javascript]
----
import {HttpClient} from "@angular/common/http";
import {Injectable, Inject} from "@angular/core";
import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';

export class Contact {
  private apiRoot: string = "http://localhost:3000/contacts";

  constructor(@Inject(HttpClient) private http: HttpClient) {
  }

  query(params: { string: string }) {
    return this.http.get(this.apiRoot, { params }).toPromise();
  }

  get(id, params?: { string: string }) {
    return this.http.get(this.apiRoot + '/' + id, { params }).toPromise();
  }

  save(data: any) {
    return this.http.post(this.apiRoot, data).toPromise();
  }

  update(data: any) {
    return this.http.put(this.apiRoot + '/' + data.id, data).toPromise();
  }

  remove(data: any) {
    return this.http.delete(this.apiRoot + '/' + data.id).toPromise();
  }
}

angular
  .module("codecraft")
  .service("Contact", Contact);
----

== Downgrading our Contact Resource
Lets take a step back and try and visualize what we have done now.

We have taken the leaf node of our application (the Resource entity) and re-written it in Angular. But we still need to use this Resource entity within our AngularJS Service entity. in order to maintain this compatibility, we need to _downgrade_ our Resource entity so that it can be used inside an AngularJS service.

First, import the `downgradeInjectable` function into our class like so:
[source, javascript]
----
import {downgradeInjectable} from '@angular/upgrade/static';
----

Next, modify the component registration code from a `service` to a `factory` and wrap the `Contact` class using our newly imported function so that it can be used inside AngularJS:

[source, javascript]
----
angular
  .module("codecraft")
  .factory("Contact", downgradeInjectable(Contact));
----

Finally, to make our `Contact` resource available to the  Angular Dependency Injection Framework, add it as a `provider` in the `main.ts` file. You will also need to add the `HttpClientModule` to the `imports` array so that it can be used inside the `Contact` resource:

[source, javascript]
----
....
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    UpgradeModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [
    Contact
  ]
})
....
----

With this, we have now completed the conversion of our Resource entity to Angular, followed by downgrading it to maintain compatibility with AngularJS.
